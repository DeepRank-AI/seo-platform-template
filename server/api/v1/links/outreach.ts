I came across your excellent article about {topic} on {site_name} and was impressed by {personalized_observation}.

I recently published a comprehensive guide on {your_topic} that I think would be valuable for your readers: {your_url}

Some key points covered in the guide:
- {key_point_1}
- {key_point_2}
- {key_point_3}

Would you be interested in including it as a resource in your article?

Best regards,
{your_name}`,
        follow_up: `Hi {name},

Just following up on my previous email about the {topic} resource. Let me know if you'd like any additional information.

Best regards,
{your_name}`
